# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
In this challenge, web scraping was used in order to visit a website that had data & images on mars. The end output was an html website that scraped the most recent news articles on mars, and also featured images from the website that was visited.

### Summary
A list was created in order to hold the JPG image URL strings and titles for each image. The ipynb file code had the task of retrieving the full-resolution image URL and titles for each image. The index.html file was also modified so it could access the Mongo database & retrieve the img_urls & titles as it looped through the dictionaries in the database.
